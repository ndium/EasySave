# EasySave Software

EasySave is a backup software that allows users to store data (files, folders, etc.) on an alternative medium such as an external hard drive or the cloud. The primary goal is to safeguard data in case of loss or damage to the original storage device. Additionally, users can choose the data to be backed up, select the type of backup, encrypt data for enhanced security, and review logs to track the history of operations. It's worth noting that the software is available in both French and English, providing a multilingual interface.
